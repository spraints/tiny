# [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com)

I use influxdb to collect data directly from my [wirless tag manager](https://mytaglist.com). I mostly use their service to view data, but if my internet connection is down it's useful to be able to see what's going on.

## Usage

    ./start
    # Browse to http://tiny.local:8086 to view data or configure it.
