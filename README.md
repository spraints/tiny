# Tiny

Tiny is a small server (mini-ATX or micro-ITX) that runs a bunch of stuff on my home network. See the individual directories for details about what's there. Most of the stuff here runs in docker containers. Some is off-the-shelf software and some is custom. There are some things that need to run on tiny, and you can install them with `./bootstrap.sh`.

## Usage

To spin everything up, `cd` into the various directories and run their `./start` scripts.
